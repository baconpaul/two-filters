Two Filters

Manual: There's no manual yet.

Testing our filter library by making a little two filter step sequencer plugin

You've downloaded the zip file for either windows or linux (both have this same README) containing a clap,
a vst3, and a standalone executable.

To install the plugin you need to move the clap or vst3 to the appropriate place on your computer

On windows files, move them to `c:\program files\common files\clap` or `\vst3`
On linux, it is usually ~/.clap, ~/.vst or /usr/lib/clap and /usr/lib/vst3

To install just move the file into those locations using whatever mechanism you are happiest with
in your environment.

If you have feedback ideas etc open a github issue or drop into the #baconpaul-sidequests channel
of surge discord.
