# Two Filters

Work in progress

It currently has two filters

Soon it will have a bit of modulation and then it will be done

## BP Todo

- get those on screen with fixed mod matrix to cutoffs, resonances, morphs, mix and feedback
  - Rate 
  - Smooth
  - To F1C/M/R To F2C/M/R
  - To FB, toMix

Then:
6. Set up your signing certs and undo the commented out bit in wf

Later if it is popular:
- show the modulated response in the ui also
- CLAP non-destructive modulation
