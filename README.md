# SideQuest Starting Point

- a step sequencer and envelope to trigger each with an impact
- and maybe a little lfo and an input envelope follower

6. Set up your signing certs and undo the commented out bit in wf
7. Edit resources/NightlyBlurb.md an dresources/ReadmeZip.txt
8. Make your own nightly tag and turn on write perm for actions
