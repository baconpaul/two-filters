# Two Filters

Work in progress

It currently has two filters

Soon it will have a bit of modulation and then it will be done

## BP Todo

- a step sequencer pair
- an envelope with gate sequencer
- get those on screen with fixed mod matrix to cutoffs, resonances, morphs, mix and feedback
- show the modulated response in the ui also 

Details:
- render thread snaps values at a better time not from patch on other thread

Then:
6. Set up your signing certs and undo the commented out bit in wf
7. Edit resources/NightlyBlurb.md an dresources/ReadmeZip.txt
8. Make your own nightly tag and turn on write perm for actions
