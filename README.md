# Two Filters

Two Filters, Two Step Sequencers, and some fixed mod paths. Download the plugin here
https://github.com/baconpaul/two-filters/releases/tag/Nightly

Really, its a test bed for our new Filter API. But you may find it fun. Some people have!

Special thanks for discord user `@wshaper` for providing some of the great presets
in the plugin!
